You are helping a candidate build the highest-impact personal project to land a Data / Quant role at Risk Labs (the team behind Across Protocol and UMA).

Project name: Across Liquidity Fragmentation  
Goal: A live, beautiful dashboard that shows exactly where relayer capital is getting stuck across 15+ chains and predicts when each chain will run out of liquidity.  
This directly solves Across’s publicly-stated beautifulottleneck in 2025: capital rotation stuck at ~8× per day because of liquidity fragmentation.

Across documentation source: https://docs.across.to/

Why this project wins the job:
- Uses only public data (Dune + tiny on-chain calls)
- Demonstrates deep understanding of Across V3 mechanics (intents, relayers, SpokePools)
- Shows immediate business impact: “Base runs dry in 1.4 hours” → product/eng can act instantly

Exact requirements – the dashboard MUST show (live, every 15 minutes):
1. Net flow matrix last 1h / 6h / 24h (which directions are imbalanced)
2. Current relayer capital per chain (USD)
3. Hours until dry per chain (capital ÷ hourly outflow) with red/yellow/green alerts
4. Gini fragmentation score + historical trend
5. Post-bridge user behavior heatmap (where money goes next: idle / yield / bridge again)
6. LLM-powered natural language summary + recommendation (e.g. “Prioritise Unichain launch: 28% of arrived capital sits idle >48h”)

Tech stack (must be simple and cheap):
- 100% Python
- Data → Dune SQL (primary) + tiny web3.py RPC fallback for current capital
- Dashboard → Streamlit (deploy free on Streamlit Community Cloud or GitHub Pages)
- No paid APIs, no heavy infra

Dune Analytics:
Every chain has its own schema under across_v3.<chain>_spokepool
Example for Base: across_v3.base_spokepool

Key tables and their exact columns:

1. fillV3Relay → instant fills (money arriving on destination chain)

Column                  | Type           | Description (what it actually means)
------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------
contract_address        | varbinary      | SpokePool address → tells you the destination chain
call_success            | boolean        | Was the fill successful? (almost always true)
call_tx_hash            | varbinary      | Transaction hash (open on block explorer)
call_tx_from            | varbinary      | Who sent the tx (usually the relayer or a bot)
call_tx_to              | varbinary      | Same as contract_address (the SpokePool)
call_tx_index           | integer        | Position of tx in block (ignore)
call_trace_address      | array(bigint)  | Internal call path (ignore)
call_block_time         | timestamp      | Exact moment user received money on destination chain
call_block_number       | bigint         | Block number (ignore)
call_block_date         | date           | Date part of block_time
relayData               | varchar        | Giant JSON string → contains all the real data (amounts, tokens, chains, addresses)
repaymentChainId        | uint256        | Chain ID where the relayer will eventually get repaid → origin chain
   
Example sql query:
SELECT * FROM across_v3_base.base_spokepool_call_fillv3relay limit 5;
Output SQL query:

2. executeRelayerRefundLeaf → repayments (capital freed again)
   Columns vary slightly per chain but always contain:
   - chainId
   - repaymentToken
   - repaymentAmount (uint256)
   - block_time

3. depositfunction → user started a bridge (origin chain outflow)
   Similar structure to fillV3Relay
